			A Pandemic Special passion project from the bottom of my well of being. As I turned inside
			over the course of the last year of involuntary isolation, I was reminded of the source that
			once surprised me. Practicing divination with the YÃ¬jÄ«ng (a.k.a. I Ching) has really peeled
			the onion, and renewed my trust in that tiny voice calling up from the bottom of the well of
			being seated deep in heart center. I can't promise that you'll be able to divine the future,
			but you just might understand this moment from a new and ancient vantage point, one that feels
			like an old friend.
