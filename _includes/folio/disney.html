    <p>Following Togetherville's acquisition by Disney Interactive, I was ushered into the skunkfolios where our raw creativity and technological acumen interwove to dream up the most magical (and plausible) wonders we could offer to the world under the banner of the Mouse.</p>
    <p>First I led the former Togetherville to secure <a target="_blank" href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US9390243B2/en">a patent for the Dynamic Trust Score</a>, which represented the effulgence of our IP. We then proceeded on to architect the integration of the company's identity platforms into what was termed <a href="https://www.disneyid.com/">Disney ID</a>. </p>
    <p>That's when the real fun began. In a few short months our little task force spun up and pitched a squall line of concepts, some of which have taken nearly a decade to come to fruition. The lion's share of the folio remains under closed source. But here are some teasers:</p>
      <ul class="details">
        <li>a precursor to Pokemon Go featuring digital collectible characters living in AR,</li>
        <li>a celestial Disney jukebox that became the <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/">Disney+</a> streaming service, and</li>
        <li>an evolution of Disney Pins involving smart, wearable collectibles that are now called <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/plan/my-disney-experience/bands-cards/">Magic
            Bands</a>.</li>
      </ul>
