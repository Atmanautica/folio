# Working in the Gift

This year, I have begun to transition my work into the Gift. This means that I no longer enter into contracts or make agreements of exchange, but rather offer my talents and services freely as gifts to whom I choose, and just as openly accept and receive gifts from whomever wishes me and my family well.

## Gift FAQ

If you have arrived here with some unsolved mysteries about what it means to live and work in the Gift, allow me to address some frequent inquiries.

### Why do you work in the gift?

My motives are those of an altruistic hedonist: it feels better and feels right.

My secondary motive is less selfish: our economy, ecology, and psyches are breaking. I agree with Charles Eisenstein's three-pronged prescription for repairing things.

### How does working in the Gift impact your work?

The work I do flows much more easily and tends to be more enriched with generosity and creativity when it is a gift from my heart to yours, rather than the mechanical fulfillment of expectations we conjure and construct into ironclad agreements.
