It seems to me that 2021 will be the year the masks come off. So here goes nothing.

Consulting as Atmanautica has been a treat. Originally I conceived of Atmanautica as a vehicle for weaving more spirit into my career in technology. This aspiration has proven tricky to define, difficult to convey, and not altogether useful as I field new clients and navigate the choppy post-pandemic waters.

So today I'm dropping the Atmanautica mask and re-emerging to offer the same raw, unbridled systems thinking driven strategy, development, and design here at [krry](https://github.com/krry).dev.

May we all become maskless, at ease, and fancy-free as we re-inhabit this post-[Coronation](https://charleseisenstein.org/essays/the-coronation/) planet.
